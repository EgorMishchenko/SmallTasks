1) BinaryTreeComparer:

  We have a class representing binary tree nodes: 
  class BTN { 
      int val; 
      BTN left; 
      BTN right; 
  } 
  Please implement method to compare 2 such trees (returns: true if fully equal, false - otherwise) 

2) FilterCollection:
  We have a class : class Element { int num; String name; int age; } please implement method taking Collection<Element> 
  as an argument and returning Collection<Element> where all elements are unique by "num" and age>20. 
  In case of ambiguity, put in target collection any of input elements.
